\section*{Problem}
Consider any tall matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, which may be rank deficient, and a corresponding vector $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Under what condition(s) does an exact solution $x$ exist for the system of equations $Ax = b$?
    \item Develop a complete description for the solution $x$. 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Solution}

We are asked to analyze the linear system
\[
A x = b, \quad A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}, \; b \in \mathbb{R}^m,
\]
where $A$ is a tall matrix ($m \geq n$) which may be rank-deficient.

\subsection*{Existence of a solution}
The system $Ax = b$ has a solution if and only if $b$ lies in the column space of $A$, i.e.
\[
b \in R(A).
\]
If $b \notin R(A)$, then no exact solution exists.

\subsection*{Description of the solution}
Assume $b \in R(A)$. Then there exists at least one solution $x_p$ such that
\[
A x_p = b.
\]
The set of all solutions can be described using the null space $N(A)$.  
If $z \in N(A)$, then
\[
A(x_p + z) = A x_p + A z = b + 0 = b.
\]
Therefore, every solution can be written as
\[
x = x_p + z, \quad z \in N(A).
\]

\subsection*{Final Answer}
The system has a solution if and only if $b \in R(A)$.  
If a solution exists, then the general solution is
\[
x = x_p + N(A),
\]
where $x_p$ is any particular solution and $N(A)$ is the null space of $A$.

\noindent If $A$ has full column rank ($\text{rank}(A) = n$), then $N(A) = \{0\}$ and the solution is unique.

\noindent If $A$ is rank-deficient, then $N(A)$ has nonzero dimension and the solution set forms an affine subspace.
